        Graphic design is a profession,<sup>[2]</sup> 
        academic discipline<sup>[3]</sup><sup>[4]</sup><sup>[5]</sup> 
        and applied art whose activity consists 
        in projecting visual communications intended to transmit specific 
        messages to social groups, with specific objectives.[6] Graphic design 
        is an interdisciplinary branch of design<sup>[1]</sup> 
        and of the fine arts. 
        Its practice involves creativity, innovation and lateral thinking using 
        manual or digital tools, where it is usual to use text and 
        graphics to communicate visually.
        <br> </br>
        The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is that 
        of encoder or interpreter of the message. 
        They work on the interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual 
        messages. Usually, graphic design uses the aesthetics of typography and 
        the compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to 
        convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what language alone 
        expresses. The design work can be based on a customer's demand, a demand 
        that ends up being established linguistically, either orally or in 
        writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic message 
        into a graphic manifestation.<sup>[7]</sup>
        <br> </br>
        Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of 
        knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For example, 
        it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be applied 
        in the aviation world<sup>[8]</sup> or space exploration.
        <sup>[9]</sup><sup>[10]</sup> In this sense, in 
        some countries graphic design is related as only associated with the 
        production of sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual 
        communication is a small part of a huge range of types and classes where 
        it can be applied.
        <br> </br>
        With origins in Antiquity and the Middle Ages,
        <sup>[11]</sup> graphic design as 
        applied art was initially linked to the boom of rise of printing in 
        Europe in the 15th century and the growth of consumer culture in the 
        Industrial Revolution. From there it emerged as a distinct profession 
        in the West, closely associated with advertising in the 19th century
        <sup>[12]</sup> 
        and its evolution allowed its consolidation in the 20th century. 
        Given the rapid and massive growth in information exchange today, 
        the demand for experienced designers is greater than ever, particularly 
        because of the development of new technologies and the need to pay 
        attention to human factors beyond the competence of the engineers 
        who develop them.<sup>[13]</sup>

            modeling, animation, programming, among other fields.[1]"

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <hr>
        William Addison Dwiggins is often credited with first using the term 
        "graphic design" in a 1922 article,<sup>[14]</sup> 
        although it appears in a 
        4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of Organized Labor, a 
        publication of the Labor Unions of San Francisco, in an article 
        about technical education for printers:<sup>[15]</sup>
        <br> </br>
        An Enterprising Trades Union
        … The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails among 
        printers is 
        an assurance that with the elemental principles of design at their 
        finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge and develop into 
        specialists in graphic design and decorating. …
        <br> </br>
        A decade later, the 1917-1918 course catalog of the California School 
        of Arts & Crafts advertised a course titled Graphic Design and 
        Lettering, which replaced one called Advanced Design and Lettering. 
        Both classes were taught by Frederick Meyer.<sup>[16]</sup>
        <br> </br>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <hr>
        <i>Main Article:</i> History of Graphic Design
        <br> </br>
        In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of 
        visual communication in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction 
        between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art has disappeared. 
        They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, languages and 
        sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate 
        objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, 
        "the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, 
        and feeling to artifacts that document the human experience."
        <sup>[17]</sup>
        <br> </br>
        The definition of the graphic designer profession is relatively recent 
        concerning its preparation, activity, and objectives. Although there is 
        no consensus on an exact date when graphic design emerged, some date it 
        back to the Interwar period. Others understand that it began to be 
        identified as such by the late 19th century.<sup>[11]</sup>
        <br> </br>
        It can be argued that graphic communications with specific purposes have 
        their origins in Paleolithic cave paintings and the birth of written 
        language in the third millennium BCE. However, the differences in 
        working methods, auxiliary sciences, and required training are such that 
        it is not possible to clearly identify the current graphic designer with 
        prehistoric man, the 15th-century xylographer, 
        or the lithographer of 1890.
        <br> </br>
        The diversity of opinions stems from some considering any graphic 
        manifestation as a product of graphic design, while others only 
        recognize those that arise as a result of the application of an 
        industrial production model—visual manifestations that have been 
        "projected" to address various needs: productive, symbolic, ergonomic, 
        contextual, among others.
        <br> </br>
        Nevertheless, the evolution of graphic design as a practice and 
        profession has been closely linked to technological innovations, 
        social needs, and the visual imagination of professionals.
        <sup>[18]</sup> 
        Graphic design has been practiced in various forms throughout history; 
        in fact, good examples of graphic design date back to manuscripts from 
        ancient China, Egypt, and Greece. As printing and book production 
        developed in the 15th century, advances in graphic design continued over 
        the subsequent centuries, with composers or typographers often designing 
        pages according to established type.<sup>[11]</sup>
        <br> </br>
        By the late 19th century, graphic design emerged as a distinct 
        profession in the West, partly due to the process of 
        labor specialization that occurred there and partly due to the new 
        technologies and business possibilities brought about by the 
        Industrial Revolution. New production methods led to the separation of 
        the design of a communication medium (such as a poster) from its actual 
        production. Increasingly, throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, 
        advertising agencies, book publishers, and magazines hired art directors 
        who organized all visual elements of communication and integrated them 
        into a harmonious whole, creating an expression appropriate to the 
        content. In 1922, typographer William A. Dwiggins coined the term 
        graphic design to identify the emerging field.<sup>[11]</sup>
        <br> </br>
        Throughout the 20th century, the technology available to designers 
        continued to advance rapidly, as did the artistic and commercial 
        possibilities of design. The profession expanded greatly, and graphic 
        designers created, among other things, magazine pages, book covers, 
        posters, CD covers, postage stamps, packaging, brands, signs, 
        advertisements, kinetic titles for TV programs and movies, and websites. 
        By the early 21st century, graphic design had become a global profession 
        as advanced technology and industry spread worldwide.<sup>[11]</sup>

        <h2>Historical Background</h2>
        <i>Main Article:</i> History of paintings
        <br> </br>
        In China, during the Tang dynasty (618-907) wood blocks were cut to 
        print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist 
        scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning 
        in the 11th century in China, longer scrolls and books were produced 
        using movable type printing, making books widely available during the 
        Song dynasty (960-1279).<sup>[19]</sup>
        <br> </br>
        n the mid-15th century in Mainz, Germany, Johannes Gutenberg developed a 
        way to reproduce printed pages at a faster pace using movable type made 
        with a new metal alloy<sup>[20]</sup> that created a revolution in the 
        dissemination of information.<sup>[21]<sup>
            <br>
        <h1>Nineteenth centruy</h1>
        <br>
        In 1849, Henry Cole became one of the major forces in design education 
        in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design 
        in his Journal of Design and Manufactures. He organized the Great 
        Exhibition as a celebration of modern industrial technology and 
        Victorian design.
        <br> </br>
        From 1891 to 1896, William Morris' Kelmscott Press was a leader in 
        graphic design associated with the Arts and Crafts movement, creating 
        hand-made books in medieval and Renaissance era style,<sup>[22]</sup> 
        in addition 
        to wallpaper and textile designs.<sup>[23]</sup> 
        Morris' work, along with the rest 
        of the Private Press movement, directly influenced Art Nouveau.
        <sup>[24]</sup>
        <br> </br>
        Will H. Bradley became one of the notable graphic designers in the late 
        nineteenth-century due to creating art pieces in various Art 
        Nouveau styles. Bradley created a number of designs as promotions for a 
        literary magazine titled The Chap-Book.<sup>[25]</sup>

        In 1917, Frederick H. Meyer, director and instructor at the California 
        School of Arts and Crafts, taught a class entitled "Graphic Design and 
        Lettering".<sup>[26]</sup> Raffe's Graphic Design, 
        published in 1927, was the first 
        book to use "Graphic Design" in its title.<sup>[27]</sup> 
        In 1936, author and 
        graphic designer Leon Friend published his book titled "Graphic Design" 
        and it is known to be the first piece of literature to cover the 
        topic extensively.<sup>[28]</sup>
        <br> </br>
        The signage in the London Underground is a classic design example
        <sup[29]</sup> of the modern era. Although he lacked artistic training, 
        Frank Pick led the Underground Group design and publicity movement. The 
        first Underground station signs were introduced in 1908 with a design of 
        a solid red disk with a blue bar in the center and the name of the 
        station. The station name was in white sans-serif letters. It was in 
        1916 when Pick used the expertise of Edward Johnston to design a new 
        typeface for the Underground. Johnston redesigned the Underground sign 
        and logo to include his typeface on the blue bar in the center of a red 
        circle.<sup>[30]</sup>
        <br> </br>
        In the 1920s, Soviet constructivism applied 'intellectual production' in 
        different spheres of production. The movement saw individualistic art as 
        useless in revolutionary Russia and thus moved towards creating objects 
        for utilitarian purposes. They designed buildings, theater sets, posters
        , fabrics, clothing, furniture, logos, menus, etc.<sup>[31]</sup>

             different designers, for different purposes, and combined by 
             designer Raymond Loewy in this one single aircraft

        Jan Tschichold codified the principles of modern typography in his 1928 
        book, New Typography.<sup>[32]</sup> He later repudiated the philosophy 
        he espoused in this book as fascistic, but it remained influential.
        [citation needed] Tschichold, Bauhaus typographers such as Herbert Bayer 
        and László Moholy-Nagy and El Lissitzky greatly influenced graphic 
        design. They pioneered production techniques[citation needed] and 
        stylistic devices used throughout the twentieth century. The following 
        years saw graphic design in the modern style gain widespread acceptance 
        and application.<sup>[33]</sup>
        <br> </br>
        The professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with 
        consumerism. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within 
        the graphic design community with the First Things First manifesto. 
        First launched by Ken Garland in 1964, it was re-published as the First 
        Things First 2000 manifesto in 1999 in the magazine Emigre 51
        <sup>[34]</sup> stating "We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of 
        more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication - a mindshift 
        away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of 
        a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. 
        Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other 
        perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and 
        resources of design."<sup>[35]</sup>
        <br> </br>
        <h1>Applications</h1>
        <hr> <br> </br>
        Graphic design can have many applications, from road signs to technical 
        schematics and reference manuals. It is often used in branding products 
        and elements of company identity such as logos, colors, packaging, 
        labelling and text.
        <br> </br>
        From scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion 
        and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of 
        visual information - known as information design. With the advent of the 
        web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are 
        increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. 
        Information design can include Data and information visualization, which 
        involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually 
        compelling presentation, and can be tied in with information graphics.

        The "process school" is concerned with communication; it highlights the 
        channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which 
        senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. The semiotic 
        school treats a message as a construction of signs which through 
        interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.

        <h1>Typeography</h1>
        <i>Main Article:</i> Typography
        <br> </br>
        Typography includes type design, modifying type glyphs and arranging 
        type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using 
        illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, 
        point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), 
        kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading 
        (line spacing).
        <br> </br>
        Typography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, 
        graphic artists, art directors, and clerical workers. Until the digital 
        age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate 
        or resemble stereotypical notions. For example, 1942 Report is a font 
        which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.

        <h1>Page Layout</h1>
        Further information: Grid (graphic design)
        <br> </br>
        Page layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, 
        such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always 
        been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to 
        displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of type (text), 
        images (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder 
        graphics such as a dieline for elements that are not printed with ink 
        such as die/laser cutting, foil stamping or blind embossing.
        <br> </br>
        <h1>Grids</h1>
        <br> </br>
        A grid serves as a method of arranging both space and information, 
        allowing the reader to easily comprehend the overall project. 
        Furthermore, a grid functions as a container for information and a means 
        of establishing and maintaining order. Despite grids being utilized for 
        centuries, many graphic designers associate them with Swiss design. The 
        desire for order in the 1940s resulted in a highly systematic approach 
        to visualizing information. However, grids were later regarded as 
        tedious and uninteresting, earning the label of "designersaur." Today, 
        grids are once again considered crucial tools for professionals, whether 
        they are novices or veterans.<sup>[37]</sup>
        <br> </br>
        <h1>Tools</h1>
        <hr> <br>
        In the mid-1980s desktop publishing and graphic art software 
        applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation 
        capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers 
        enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic 
        changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional 
        tools such as pencils can be useful even when computers are used for 
        finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as 
        part of the creative process.<sup>[38]</sup> Styluses can be used with 
        tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.<sup>[39]</sup>
        <br> </br>
        <h1>Computers & Software</h1>
        <br> </br>
        Designers disagree whether computers enhance the creative process.
        <sup>[40]</sup> Some designers argue that computers allow them to 
        explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved 
        by hand-rendering or paste-up.<sup>[41]</sup> While other designers 
        find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or 
        endless iterations with no clear outcome.
        <br> </br>
        Most designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and 
        computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered layouts are used to 
        get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is 
        produced on a computer.
        <br> </br>
        Graphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for 
        image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and 
        "industry standard" software programs used by graphic designers since 
        the early 1990s are products of Adobe Inc. Adobe Photoshop 
        (a raster-based program for photo editing) and Adobe Illustrator 
        (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. 
        CorelDraw, a vector graphics editing software developed and marketed by 
        Corel Corporation, is also used worldwide. Designers often use 
        pre-designed raster images and vector graphics in their work from online 
        design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, vector 
        logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator and CorelDraw, and the 
        final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such 
        as Adobe InDesign, Serif PagePlus and QuarkXPress.
        <br> </br>
        Many free and open-source programs are also used by both professionals 
        and casual graphic designers. Inkscape uses Scalable Vector Graphics 
        (SVG) as its primary file format and allows importing and exporting 
        other formats. Other open-source programs used include GIMP for 
        photo-editing and image manipulation, Krita for digital painting, and 
        Scribus for page layout.
