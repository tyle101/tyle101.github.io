            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches 
            leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees. Trees in windy 
            areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during
             winds. The abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness 
             response. Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely 
             uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.
             [10] If the crowns are artificially prevented from colliding in the 
             winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps.[11] This explains 
             instances of crown shyness between branches of the same organism. 
             Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is particularly seen in 
             conditions conducive to this pruning, including windy forests, 
             stands of flexible trees, and early succession forests where 
             branches are flexible and limited in lateral movement.[6][12] 
             According to this theory, variable flexibility in lateral branches 
             greatly influences the degree of crown shyness.
