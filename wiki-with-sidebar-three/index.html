                <h1>History of Traveling</h1>
            <p>
                Travel dates back to antiquity where wealthy Greeks and Romans 
                would travel for leisure to their summer homes and villas in 
                cities such as Pompeii and Baiae.[8] While early travel tended 
                to be slower, more dangerous, and more dominated by trade and 
                migration, cultural and technological advances over many years 
                have tended to mean that travel has become easier and more 
                accessible.[9] Humankind has come a long way in transportation 
                since Christopher Columbus sailed to the New World from Spain in 
                1492, an expedition which took over 10 weeks to arrive at the 
                final destination; to the 21st century when aircraft allows 
                travel from Spain to the United States overnight.

                Travel in the Middle Ages offered hardships and challenges, 
                though it was important to the economy and to society. The 
                wholesale sector depended (for example) on merchants dealing 
                with/through caravans or sea-voyagers, end-user retailing often 
                demanded the services of many itinerant peddlers wandering from 
                village to hamlet, gyrovagues (wandering monks) and wandering 
                friars brought theology and pastoral support to neglected areas, 
                traveling minstrels toured, and armies ranged far and wide in 
                various crusades and in sundry other wars.[8] Pilgrimages were 
                common in both the European and Islamic world and involved 
                streams of travelers both locally and internationally.[10]

                In the late 16th century, it became fashionable for young 
                European aristocrats and wealthy upper-class men to travel to 
                significant European cities as part of their education in the 
                arts and literature. This was known as the Grand Tour, and 
                included cities such as London, Paris, Venice, Florence, and 
                Rome. However, the French Revolution brought with it the end of 
                the Grand Tour.[8]

                Travel by water often provided more comfort and speed than 
                land-travel, at least until the advent of a network of railways 
                in the 19th century. Travel for the purpose of tourism is 
                reported to have started around this time when people began to 
                travel for fun as travel was no longer a hard and challenging 
                task. This was capitalized on by people like Thomas Cook selling 
                tourism packages where trains and hotels were booked together.
                [11] Airships and airplanes took over much of the role of 
                long-distance surface travel in the 20th century, notably after 
                the Second World War where there was a surplus of both aircraft 
                and pilots.[8] Air travel has become so ubiquitous in the 
                21st century that one woman, Alexis Alford, visited all 196 
                countries before the age of 21

                <h3>Purpose & Motivation</h3>
            <p>
                Reasons for traveling include recreation,[4] holidays, 
                rejuvenation,[5]tourism[4] or vacationing,[4]research travel,[4] 
                the gathering of information, visiting people, volunteer travel 
                for charity, migration to begin life somewhere else, religious 
                pilgrimages[4] and mission trips, business travel,[4]trade,
                [4]commuting, obtaining health care,[4] waging or fleeing war, 
                for the enjoyment of traveling, or other reasons. Travelers may 
                use human-powered transport such as walking or bicycling; or 
                vehicles, such as public transport, automobiles, trains, ferries
                , boats, cruise ships and airplanes.

                <h2>Safety</h2>
                <hr>
            <p>
                Authorities emphasize the importance of taking precautions to 
                ensure travel safety.[16] When traveling abroad, the odds favor 
                a 
                safe and incident-free trip, however, travelers can be subject 
                to 
                difficulties, crime and violence.[17] Some safety considerations 
                include being aware of one’s surroundings,[16] avoiding being 
                the 
                target of a crime,[16] leaving copies of one’s passport and 
                itinerary information with trusted people,[16] obtaining medical 
                insurance valid in the country being visited[16] and registering 
                with one’s national embassy when arriving in a foreign country.
                [16]

            <p> 
                Many countries do not recognize drivers’ licenses from other 
                countries; however most countries accept international driving 
                permits.[18] Automobile insurance policies issued in one’s own 
                country are often invalid in foreign countries, and it is often 
                a 
                requirement to obtain temporary auto insurance valid in the 
                country 
                being visited.[18] It is also advisable to become oriented with 
                the 
                driving rules and regulations of destination countries.[18] 
                Wearing 
                a seat belt is highly advisable for safety reasons; many 
                countries 
                have penalties for violating seatbelt laws.[18]

                <h3>Geographic Types</h3>
            <p> 
                Travel may be local, regional, national (domestic) or 
                international. In some countries, non-local internal travel may 
                require an internal passport, while international travel 
                typically requires a passport and visa. Tours are a common type 
                of travel. Examples of travel tours are expedition cruises,[13] 
                small group tours,[14] and river cruises.[15]

                There are three main statistics which may be used to compare the 
                safety of various forms of travel (based on a Department of the 
                Environment, Transport and the Regions survey in October 2000):
